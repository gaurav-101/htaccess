An .htaccess file that I use for various Wordpress websites to improve performance, security, and functionality.
*Some* informal tests on *some* sites have seen them *appear* to double in speed instantly just by uploading this file to the website's root folder. **Your results may vary**. 

### Note:
Not all sections within the file may apply to you or work on your server. Comment out by prefixing the line with a # symbol or uncomment a line by removing the prefixing #.

:warning: **Caution** |
------------ |
The .htaccess is a powerful file. One wrong move in the .htaccess file can make a website inaccessible. Make sure you have a backup of any original .htaccess file to restore via FTP if that happens. If a feature doesn't work when using this file, comment out sections and use the process of elimination to determine which bit is incompatible with your hosting. Also note that the larger your htaccess is the more you'll increase your site's [TTFB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_first_byte). **Trim out what you don't need!**|
